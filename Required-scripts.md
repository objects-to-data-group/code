# Needed Information

(Place the number or numbers of the script(s) that gather (part of) the required information between brackets)

* The total number of news-items per decade within the pre-defined dataset (script 2)

* The total number of news-items per decade  within the NY-Times API (script 1)

* The total number of front-page articles per decade within the pre-defined dataset (script 2)

* The total number of front-page articles per decade within the NY-Times API (script 1)

* A percentual oversight of the number of NY-Times front-page articles in relation to the total number of NY-Times news-items (possibly excluding blogs) per decade.
	* This is needed to establish wheter the percentage of humanities articles that was placed on the front-page before the 60's was relativly equal to the high-amount of articles in the 60's and 70's. If the percentage is (close to) equal, this means we will also need to take the pre-1960 decades into account.

* A percentual oversight of the number of NY-Times front-page articles about Humanities in relation to the total number of NY-Times news-items about Humanities per decade

* A way of topic-modeling to check the development of article-subjects. We need to find out whether certain specific topics where related to the apparent rise of Humanities front-page-articles in the 1960's and 1970's.

* Figure out a way to find out if the placement of specific topic-related words within certain fields in the article (e.g. headline or first paragraph) makes it more likely for a (humanities) article to be placed on the front page. 

* We need to create an oversight of all the headlines of all the articles that where placed on the front-page together with the front-page humanaities articles. That way we can check whether there exist(s)(ed) some related topics that somehow helped the humanities articles to be placed on the front-page alongside them.
